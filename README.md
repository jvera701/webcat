The variable databaseURL is missing from the firebaseConfig object. Without it, I can't connect to de database. What I did
was to make a faker that creates 1000 people randomly. It then prints out an aggregate report every 2 seconds. To run,
please follow these steps.

1. Install dependencies with npm 
```console
npm i 
```
2. Run the project
```console
npm run start 
```
